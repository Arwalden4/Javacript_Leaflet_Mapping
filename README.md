# Project3-Group-3: Food Deserts
## Description
Food deserts are a foundational public health issue of inequality afflicting American cities and communities across the country. The city of Chicago, the third most populous city and metropolitan area in the United States, is one such area which struggles with economic inequality and restrictive access to public services among its community areas. Focusing on Chicago and its community areas, our team is interested in investigating the geographic distribution of food availability in the city. 

We want to show exactly how this problem manifests and display with precision the areas which suffer most from the inequality in access to fresh and healthy food options. To this effect, our project's code will use Javascript and HTML to display live maps populated with popups showing the locations of grocery stores, restaurants, and alcoholic vendors to vizualize Chicago's geography accordingly. This project will also store and load our data in a database, such as PostgreSQL, to manage our data in the same server.
