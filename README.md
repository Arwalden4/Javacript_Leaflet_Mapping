# Project3-Group-3: Food Deserts
## Description
Food deserts are a foundational health problem plaguing American cities and communities across the country. The city of Chicago, the third most populous city and metropolitan area in the United States, is one such area which struggles with economic inequality and restrictive access to public services among its community areas. Focusing on Chicago and its community areas, our team is interested in investigating the geographic distribution of food availability in the city. We aim to reveal exactly how this problem manifests and display the precise areas in which food deprivation is most prevalent a factor in Chicago's manifold communities. To this effect, our project's code will use Javascript and HTML to display live maps populated with popups showing the locations of grocery stores, restaurants, as well as clusters of liquor stores to show where this problem lies. We will also employ visualizations to execute our project's plan through the use of Python and Pandas dataframes or charts, drawn from our datasets. This project will also store and retrieve our data in a database, such as PostgreSQL, to manage our data in the same server.
